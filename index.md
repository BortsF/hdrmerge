HDRMerge combines two or more raw images into a single raw with an extended dynamic range. It can import any raw image supported by LibRaw, and outputs a DNG 1.4 image with floating point data. The output raw is built from the less noisy pixels of the input, so that shadows maintain as much detail as possible. This tool also offers a GUI to remove 'ghosts' from the resulting image.

# Getting Started

You may want to read the [manual]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-07-11-user-manual %}), or jump directly to the command line help with `hdrmerge --help`.


# Changelog

These are the most significant improvements by version. For a detailed changelog, see the [git commit history]({{ site.github }}/commits/master).

## v0.5

* Support for macOS.
* Multiple bug-fixes.

## v0.4.5

* Better compatibility with other programs, by producing a DNG file that maintains the original layout: frame and active area sizes, black and white levels, etc. *Note that, if you use RawTherapee, you need v4.1.23 or higher to open these files.*
* Batch mode in command line! Merge several sets of HDR images at once.
* Creation of menu launchers and a Windows installer.
* Support for CYGM and Fujifilm X-Trans sensors (experimental).
* Several bug-fixes.
* Improved accuracy and performance.

## v0.4.4

* Better support for more camera models.
* Better rendering of the embedded preview image.
* Change the edit brush radius with Alt+Mouse wheel.
* Several bugfixes.
  * The original embedded preview is not included in the output anymore.
  * Fixed some glitches with the edit tools.

## v0.4.3

* Fix segmentation fault error painting the preview of some rotated images.
* Fix DateTime tag in Windows hosts.

## v0.4.2

* Improved GUI:
  * A slider to control the brush radius.
  * A slider to control the preview exposure.
  * Movable toolbars.
  * Layer selector with color codes.
  * Improved brush visibility on different backgrounds.
  * Posibility of saving the output options.
* First release with a Windows version, both 32- and 64-bit.

## v0.4.1

* Bugfixes release

## v0.4

* Great performance improvements with OpenMP.
* Not depend anymore on DNG & XMP SDK! Windows and Mac version soon...
* More robust MBT alignment.
* More control on the logging output.
* The user may disable alignment and/or cropping. This is most useful to obtain an image of the same size as the inputs. Some programs have this requirement to apply a flat-field image, for instance.

## v0.3

The first public version of HDRMerge.

* Supports most raw format supported by LibRaw (No foveon of Fuji formats for the moment).
* Automatic alignment of small translations.
* Automatic crop to the optimal size.
* Automatic merge mask creation. The mask identifies the best source image for each pixel of the output.
* Editable merge mask, to manually select pixels from specific source images.
* Writes DNG files with 16, 24 and 32 bits per pixel.
* Writes full, half or no preview to the output image.
* Copies the EXIF data from the least exposed source image.
